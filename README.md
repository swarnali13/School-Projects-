# 🏧 ATM Machine Simulation using Python and MySQL

This project simulates an **ATM (Automated Teller Machine)** system using **Python** and **MySQL**. It allows users to perform basic banking operations through a terminal-based interface while securely interacting with a backend database.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **MySQL**
- **mysql-connector-python** (for database connectivity)

## 💡 Features

- User authentication with PIN
- Check account balance
- Deposit money
- Withdraw money (with balance check)
- Mini statement / transaction history
- Create new account (admin only)
- Exit safely

## 🧠 Educational Purpose

This project was developed as part of a school assignment to demonstrate how Python can be used to interact with a relational database system (MySQL). It teaches:

- Basic SQL operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE)
- Connecting Python with MySQL using `mysql-connector-python`
- Secure handling of user data and input validation
- Structuring a CLI-based application
